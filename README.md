# Customer-Segmentation-through-KMeans-Clustering
This project utilizes KMeans clustering to analyze customer segmentation based on two key variables: Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1- 100). By applying this unsupervised machine learning technique, we aim to identify distinct c ustomer groups within the dataset to better understand consumer behavior and preferences
.
The dataset consists of annual incomes and spending scores for a sample population. Data preprocessing steps include normalization using MinMaxScaler to ensure the features are on a comparable scale. KMeans clustering is then performed to partition the data into five clusters.
